# ***Python challenge***

# Background

In this journey i will use my Python's script skills that i've learned to analyzes tow real-world setiution.

1- financial dataset called  ***(budget_data.csv)***

2- set of poll data called  ***(election_data.csv)***

### ***Before I start I will*** :

create a folder for each Python scripting and name them : **(PyBank)** and **(PyPoll)**

In each folder has been added the following content:

A file called **(main.py)** , this will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A folder called **(Resources)**, that contains the CSV files that i used. 

A folder called **(analysis)** , that contains my text file that has the results from the analysis.

# Description

### ***The PyBank*** :

The task is to creat a Python script to analyze the financial dataset called ***(budget_data.csv)***. 

The dataset is composed of two columns: **"Date"** and **"Profit/Losses"**.

This Python script will analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

**1-** The total number of months included in the dataset

**2-** The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

**3-** The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

**4-** The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**5-** The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### ***The PyPoll*** :

The task is to creat a Python script that will helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

i will analyze the set of poll data called ***(election_data.csv)***.

The dataset is composed of three columns: **"Voter ID"**, **"County"**, and **"Candidate"**.

This Python script will analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

**1-** The total number of votes cast
